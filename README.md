# cml_remote

Remote Control for Cisco CML2.

(C) 2020 Steven Luzynski <steve@luzynski.net>

## Getting Started

This project will eventually be a full cross-platform remote UI to manage CML2 labs.

Features:
* Android/IOS support
* Windows & Linux standalone clients (pending the state of Flutter at any given moment)
* Maintain a list of servers to manage
* Show number of running labs
* Stop/start/restart existing labs

Stretch:
* Edit labs (will need to be better than the web UI or why do it)
* Download/upload labs (same comment)
* Other ideas as they occur to me
